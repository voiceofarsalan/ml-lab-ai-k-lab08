# Lab08 – Ensemble Learning (Bagging and Random Forest)

This notebook focuses on applying ensemble learning techniques to improve model performance using **Bagging** and **Random Forest** classifiers. A dataset is processed, models are trained, and results are analyzed to understand how ensemble methods enhance prediction accuracy.
